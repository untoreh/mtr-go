		The Moche people lived on Peru’s north coast long before the Spanish conquest of the Americas. They grew corn and squash, built monumental adobe temples and were master craftsmen in gold and ceramics.

		They never had the chance to sell their wares on Etsy, and yet they anticipated some of our most modern anxieties.

		Like us, they saw themselves living in a vulnerable world where the technology created to make their lives better was just as likely to turn against them. While we worry about our baby monitors and home routers being hijacked by malicious hackers, they perceived a world in which everyday objects like jugs and clothes might come to life with ominous consequences.

		Moche artists painted scenes of this happening on ceramic vessels and on the walls of their temples. They appear whimsical to us today — items of clothing, weaving implements, weapons, all with arms and legs, hands and feet, some with heads and faces, on parade or engaged in battle — but for the Moche they may have represented a deep-seated uncertainty and fear about the ultimate fate of the human-created world.

		In some scenes, the animated objects are docile. In one, bowls piled with food and jugs have grown legs and walk toward human figures participating in a ceremony; some helpful jugs even bend over to pour liquid into vessels.

		But other paintings show a world turned upside down, where the objects have taken charge: They fight and defeat human warriors and parade naked human captives.

		In an excavation in 1991 near the town of San José de Moro, archaeologists, including one of the authors of this piece, Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, discovered the lavish tomb of a Moche priestess. Her coffin had been anthropomorphized, with a mask representing the priestess’ face on top and with arms and legs fashioned from copper on the sides.

		Inherent in the idea that objects have life is the more subversive concept that they also have desires; feel hate and love; seek revenge; and have the capacity to act on their own.

		In the modern world, most of the objects that surround us are a result of an impersonal process of production — they come from factories, we buy them in stores or online. For the Moche, objects were not produced — they were created, imbuing them with the ambiguity and mystery with which life is given to animated beings.

		Such objects could be either beneficial or dangerous, depending on whether they decided to serve their creators or turn against them, either of their own volition or through the black arts of others.

		We now live in a world where objects once again have life. We can talk to them and they can answer back, as is the case with Alexa and Siri and their digital kin. With their help we can control and organize the world around us: We can make sure our homes are safe, turn lights and appliances on or off, summon a taxi or order food from a restaurant. Little by little we are transferring to these technologies the tasks that we used to do ourselves, and at the same time, we are giving them control over our surroundings.

		The internet of things is made up of billions of everyday devices connected for convenience to the web. Last fall, hackers attacked this network, commandeering as many as 100,000 of these devices by using malicious software that guessed at their simple, factory-set passwords, and then ordering them to send volleys of nuisance messages to the computers of a company called Dyn, which functions as a sort of switchboard for the internet. That was enough to cripple many major websites, including Twitter and Netflix. We have given life to these things, but now we know that they do not obey only us.

		There are alternative interpretations of the Moche ceramic paintings, and some researchers do not see a sinister component. But the paintings have an echo in a myth collected in central Peru in the early 17th century. In the myth, the sun dies, the world is plunged into darkness and household objects and domesticated animals revolt: Mortars and grinding stones eat people, and llamas drive humans.

		Andean people before the conquest created a philosophical and spiritual system built around the concepts of duality and transformation — light versus darkness, order versus chaos.

		The modern world is full of such opportunities for chaos, often created by humans and the increasing sophistication and technology-centeredness of modern life. A solar flare has the potential to disrupt electrical networks. A tsunami can flood a nuclear reactor. The digitalization of stock markets leads to flash crashes. Russian hackers stealing Democratic Party emails seek to influence an American presidential election.

		Order gives way to chaos. The internet of things turns on its makers.

		The Moche culture collapsed around A.D. 850. The reasons are not clear, but the collapse was most likely a result of the Moche’s inability to cope with a hostile and perhaps changing environment, including the failure of their technology, knowledge and institutions to help them overcome those challenges. We can be certain that the technology they created did not rebel against them. But neither did it save them when they needed it the most.

		"ssdasa" : `

		A thick forest thrives on hardened lava that once flowed down Mount Fuji’s northwestern flank into lakes that reflect the volcano’s snow-capped cone like rippling mirrors. Within it, the roots of hemlock and cypress trees snake out over the ground through a blanket of moss, and trails lead to deep caverns filled with ice.

		The Aokigahara forest, as this tangle of woods is called, was born on 12 square miles of lava from an eruption in the year 864, the biggest in 3,500 years. The event left Japan’s rulers awe-struck and its countrymen inspired to worship the volcano as a god. A walk into this isolated place, where nature’s power to rebound from cataclysm is so clearly on display, can be intensely spiritual.

		Perhaps because of that, the woods inspire an almost reverential fear in Japan and, increasingly, beyond it. In the past year alone, three North American movies have opened with plots based on the woods’ reputation as a suicide destination and warren of paranormal activity: “The Sea of Trees” with Matthew McConaughey, “The Forest” and “The People Garden.” Those films come six years after “Suicide Forest,” a Vice documentary that has gotten more than 15 million views on YouTube and has furthered the idea that the forest is a place where people end their lives.

		I decided I would hike from Lake Shoji, the smallest of Fuji’s five lakes, for about six miles to the site of the eruption that created Aokigahara. But first, I hired a guide to take my wife and me to an area on the forest’s western edge that is popular with tourists.

		A train painted with Mount Fuji cartoons took us on the last leg of the two-hour trip from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko Station on a drizzly Friday last spring. From the station, a gateway to Fuji and its lakes, we rode a bus for 30 minutes to the Fugaku Wind Cave parking lot.

		Takaaki Abe waited for us at the trailhead in a baseball cap and hiking boots. He told us he was 65 and had guided in the forest for 15 years, which made me feel better about paying 12,000 yen (about $103) to a company called Fuji Kanko Kogyo for a two-hour nature walk and visit to two caves.

		Mr. Abe pointed his trekking pole into the forest as we started on the trail, which was crowded with families and children. The moss covering the trees retained water, allowing them to thrive without traditional soil. The ground we stood on certainly was anything but: In some places, the lava is more than 440 feet deep. There were holes, caused by violent emissions of steam, lurking in spaces between the hinoki trees, or Japanese cypress, and goyo matsu, or five-needle pines.

		At the cave, we descended stairs into a broad hole that funneled into a cavern. Backlit ice pillars glowed in hues of translucent purple, and placards said the cave was once used to refrigerate seeds and silkworm cocoons. As we left, crouching and ducking our heads, Mr. Abe clapped his hands. Tiny holes in the lava absorbed the sound. “If you yell for help, nobody will hear you,” he said.

		That comment prompted me to ask Mr. Abe if he had ever seen a ghost.

		“No,” he said with a chuckle. “But I want to.”

		I wanted to learn more about the forest, so on Wednesday I took a bus from my wife’s hometown, Kofu, about 17 miles north of Aokigahara, to the Fujisan Museum in Fujiyoshida. Headphones told me in English that after the Jogan eruption, the one that created Aokigahara, Japan’s imperial court thought it had divined the cause. The court determined that “Shinto priests’ negligence in performing religious rights” had angered the volcano, and it ordered provinces nearest Mount Fuji to increase worship of the volcano’s deity, Asama no Okami.

		“It was the biggest eruption on record, so it had the biggest impact on people,” Takeru Shinohara, the museum’s curator, told me. Construction of the Kawaguchi Asama Shrine northeast of the volcano, a site now part of Fuji’s Unesco World Heritage designation, started in 865. Today there are more than 1,000 such sacred places, known as Asama or Sengen shrines.

		I told Mr. Shinohara that I planned to hike through the forest on the route starting at Lake Shoji. He said most tourists didn’t know about the path, which is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, because few traveled beyond the more developed banks of Lake Kawaguchi and Lake Sai.

		“It’s become a forgotten trail over time,” he said.

		Two days later I was on a bus from Kawaguchiko Station to the Akaike stop at Lake Shoji. I crossed Route 139 and found the trailhead on a dead-end road behind a fire station, then followed the paved path onto the lava.

		Take just one step into Aokigahara alone and you will understand how it got its reputation. Once-molten terrain swells and dips into the distance like a petrified ocean. Vines dangle from trees and moss partially hides deep crevasses. Sadly, there is also evidence that it is a suicide forest: I saw shiny blister packs that once held pills scattered amid the leaves, and fluorescent ribbons tied to trees by either thrill seekers or people who never returned. The Vice documentary followed these ribbons to locate human remains.

		I came upon a guided group at a junction after only a few minutes.

		“Whoa, are you alone?” one of the men asked me in English. “Don’t get lost.”

		I told him not to worry, but I could understand his warning. The lava’s mineral content has a reputation for making navigational devices go haywire, and the forest looks the same in all directions. I had reached out to two Japanese geologists, Masato Koyama at Shizuoka University and Akira Takada of the Geological Survey of Japan, who said that holding a compass to the lava could move the needle, but that the device should work properly when held higher. My compasses worked fine, as did my hand-held GPS device.

		I didn’t see anyone for the next hour, until the trail crossed a road and a man wearing a helmet and kneepads stood by a red scooter. He said his name was Yoshihide Yamazaki, he was 50 and he had come from Tokyo.

		“My hobby is taking pictures of insects,” Mr. Yamazaki said. He held out laminated business cards with bug photos on them, and I took one. He said he came to Aokigahara to photograph the kamikiri mushi, or long-horned beetle.

		I asked if he became scared wandering by himself.

		“It’s dangerous if you go off the trail,” he said, holding up a plastic bag and an elastic band he wrapped around trees to avoid losing his way. “You can get lost very quickly.”

		I asked if he had ever seen a ghost. He shook his head and said, “I wouldn’t mind seeing a good ghost.”

		“What about an onryo?” I asked, using the Japanese word for a vengeful spirit.

		“Dame,” he said. No way.

		Mr. Yamazaki packed his camera into a storage compartment. “Now it’s light,” he said, looking into the forest. “But when it gets darker, it’s very scary.”

		As I approached the site of the eruption, an area where magma oozed from fissure vents near a cone on Fuji’s slope called Mount Nagaoyama, the trail cut deeper into the lava flow. Black volcanic rock rose above my head. Then the lava gradually grew sparse, grass began to line the pathway and the twisted trees of Aokigahara faded into taller pines.

		I spent the next hour trying to find a more dramatic transition, a steep drop from a lava flow or a fissure. But I never did. Aokigahara simply blended into the mountain.

		I later went to the Kawaguchi Asama Shrine. I walked under the towering red gate and toward a group of ancient cedar trees. A shrine worker handed me a pamphlet, which had a picture of a waterfall inside of it. I asked him how to get there.

		An hour later, on a trail above the waterfall that continued on to the summit of Mount Mitsutoge, the clouds pulled back like curtains and Mount Fuji appeared across the valley. I had never seen the volcano like that before, straight on and from an elevation, like a view from an airplane, and it was breathtaking.

		Beneath the snow on the upper cone, the slopes broadened upon the land for miles. I looked at the forest on the northwestern flank and tried to imagine what the Shinto priests from the shrine below me would have seen over 1,150 years ago, long before the moss and the trees and the movies.

		The suit was “at odds with the Star Trek ideals of inclusion, tolerance, unity and peace,” Axanar said in a court filing.

		Though the suit was derided by some fans, The Hollywood Reporter noted that the studios were using it to signal that they would no longer tolerate professional-quality derivatives of its movies and television series.

		On Friday, the sides announced a settlement.

		“Axanar and Mr. Peters acknowledge that both films were not approved by Paramount or CBS, and that both works crossed boundaries acceptable to CBS and Paramount relating to copyright law,” a statement attributed to all the parties said.

		The statement said the studios “continue to be big believers in fan fiction and fan creativity” and encouraged amateur filmmakers to demonstrate their passion for “Star Trek” as long as their works were nonprofessional and met the companies’ guidelines for fan films.

		Mike Bawden, a spokesman for Axanar, said the agreement allows the company to make no more than two additional films of a maximum of 15 minutes each that could be distributed on YouTube without ads. “Prelude to Axanar” can remain on YouTube without ads.

		There is no timetable for when production might begin at an Axanar studio in Valencia, Calif.

		“We’re starting from scratch,” he said in an interview on Friday. “We got a lot of work done, but the question is how do you take a 90-minute story and turn it into a 30-minute story?”

		“Axanar” is set 21 years before the original television series, which was set in the 23rd century, and tells the story of Garth of Izar, a legendary Starfleet captain who was a hero of Capt. James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Garth, who led his crew in a war against the Klingon Empire, was introduced in a 1969 episode called “Whom Gods Destroy.”
